### Description
Tool to get valid proxies from different free providers. This tool can get any number of proxies and of different type.

- Motivation

When I need to use a proxy to test an endpoint I always use the free ones offered on different websites, but it takes me several minutes to find one that works correctly, so I decided to create this tool.

- Why did I build this tool?

To make it easier for others to use free and open resources without having to waste their time verifying which proxy is operational.

- What problem does it solved?

Eliminates the need to manually check if a proxy is functional by automating the process

- What did I learn?

Use of proxies and web scraping, as some web pages do not make it easy to obtain the data
